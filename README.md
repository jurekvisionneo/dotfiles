# dotfiles

This repository just serves to sync my shell and other configs between my work and private machines. 
More advanced approaches like stow or chezmoi donâ€™t seem to be necessary yet, but never say never...

## zsh 
To source all files in the `zsh` directory you can run following command in your `.zshrc` file:
```shell
for file in /path/to/dotfiles/zsh/*; do
  [ -f "$file" ] && source "$file"
done
```

## Homebrew
Within the `brew` directory run
```shel
 brew bundle dump --cask --formula -f
``` 
to list all casks and formulas, while forcing the overrride.
