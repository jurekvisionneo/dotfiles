# dotfiles

This repository just serves to sync my shell and other configs between my work and private machines. 
More advanced approaches like stow or chezmoi donâ€™t seem to be necessary yet, but never say never...

## zsh 
To source all files in the `zsh` directory you can run following command in your `.zshrc` file:
```shell
DOTFILES_PATH="/Users/justuswolff/Repositories/dotfiles"

# source all files in the zsh folder of teh dotfiles repo
for file in "$DOTFILES_PATH/zsh/"*; do
  [ -f "$file" ] && source "$file"
done
```

## Homebrew
Within the `brew` directory run
```shell
brew bundle [--cleanup]
```
to install the Brewfile (and optionally) removing your other installations. To add your local installations run
```shell
brew bundle dump --cask --formula --tap --force
``` 
to list all casks and formulaes and forcing the overrride. This just handles installation. To upgrade already installed casks run
```shell
brew upgrade --cask --greedy  
```

## iTerm2
Load and/or export the profile configured here. I could not get the profile used by iTerm2 to be also used by VSCode but the natural key editing seems to be similar :)
